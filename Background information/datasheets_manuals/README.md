# Datasheets and manuals
The datasheets and manuals that are currently in this folder were found under the Hardware/ folder on Toledo

Should all datasheets/manuals be gathered in this one folder or remain sorted by relevant module?

Also, the Afro ESC manual is in both this folder and the ESC folder
